\section{Preliminary Questions}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item What is a differential equation, and when is it ordinary vs. partial? What is referred as the order of such equation? What constitutes as a solution to these equations?
  \item State the order of such differential equations and provide context on their application to real problems.
  \begin{equation}
      \bm{F}=m\bm{a}
  \end{equation} 
  \begin{equation}
      \frac{dQ}{dt}=kA\frac{dT}{dx}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
      \frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\Bigg(L\frac{dI}{dt}+RI+\frac{q}{c}\Bigg)
  \end{equation}
  
  \item By inspection, find one solution for each of the differential equations $y''=-\cos{x}$ and $y''=-y$.
  \item When are solutions of an $n$ order differential equation general? What information is required to obtain a particular solution from a general solution?
  \item Find the distance which an object falls under gravity in $t$ seconds using the relationship $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=g$. By algebra manipulation, find a solution to such equation and state whether it is a general or a particular solution.
  \item Separation of variables is one of the most effective methods to find solutions to differential equations. For the equations $xy'=y+1$ and $xy''=y'+1$, is it possible to use such method and why? If it is possible, do it.
 \end{itemize}

  \section{Group Problems}
  Work together as a group for the following problems. Once solved, prepare a presentation to explain the problems in an organized manner.
  \subsection{Problem 1}
  Find the position $x$ of a particle at time $t$ if its acceleration is $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=B\cos{wt}$.
  
  \subsection{Problem 2}
  Find the distance which an object moves in time $t$ if it starts from rest and has an acceleration $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-ge^{-kt}$.
 
  \subsection{Problem 3}
  Find the general solution to the following differential equation:
  \begin{equation}
      (yx^2-6y)dy=0
  \end{equation}
  
  The solution passes through the point $(4,2)$. Use this information to collapse the general solution into the particular solution of this specific boundary condition.
  
  \subsection{Problem 4}
  The growth of a bacteria population $\frac{dN}{dt}$ is proportional to the square root of the number of bacteria present at that time. If I start with a population of 10 bacteria, how much will this population have grown after 5 seconds? Take the constant of proportionality to be $2$.
  
  \subsection{Problem 5 ***CHALLENGING***}
  Linear first order differential equations can be written in the form:
  \begin{equation}
      y'+P(x)y=Q(x)
  \end{equation}
  
  Show that the general solution to this equation is:
  
  \begin{equation}
  y=e^{-I}\Bigg(\int Q(x)e^{I}dx+y_o\Bigg)     
  \end{equation}
  
  where $I=\int P(x)dx$.
  
  Hint: First consider the case where $Q(x)=0$ and obtain a solution for this case. For tidyness, remember that you can write $e^C=A$, where $C$ is the constant obtained after taking an indefinite integral. Once this specific solution is obtained, differentiate with respect to $x$ and see if you can relate your answer to the general case where $Q(x)\neq0$. 
  
  Use this property to find the general solutions to the following linear first order differential equations:

      \item $x^2y'+3xy=1$
      \item $y'+y\cos{x}=\sin{2x}$
      \item $dy+(y-e^x)dx=0$
  \end{itemize}
